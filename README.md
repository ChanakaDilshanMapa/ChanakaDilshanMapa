# Hi, I'm Chanaka ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a PhD student in Applied Math working on computational quantum chemistry. I build numerical solvers for Coupled Cluster theory and implement optimization algorithms in Julia and Python.

ðŸ”¬ Current projects:
- `ccd-solver-julia` â€“ CCD implementation with SCF, t2 amplitudes, and PES computation
- `ao-cc-solver-julia` â€“ CCD implementation in AO-based approach.
- `opt-algos` â€“ Matlab codes for ADMM, ALM, Newton, CG, etc.
- `metal-to-mott` â€“ Simulations of phase transitions in quantum lattice models

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m looking for internships in quantum chemistry and scientific computing.
